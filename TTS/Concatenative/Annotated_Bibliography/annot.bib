  annote    = {The authors of this paper investigate direct speech-to-text translation 
  				  when the source language islow-resource. They first modelled  ~300 
  				  hours of high-resource English ASR data and then applied transfer 
  				  learning approaches to fine-tune those model parameters for the 
  				  low-resource language at hand. They use BLEU machine translation 
  				  scores to quantify the end-to-end system results. Much of this study 
  				  focuses on the pre-training of the ASR encoder and how it yields the
  				  greatest improvement to the system as a whole.}

  annote    = {This paper presents a concatenative synthesizer that achieves SOTA
                      metrics on a number of tasks. Importantly the authors outline the Subjective
                      5-scale mean opinion score (MOS) which is an industry standard for detailing
                      naturalness in speech. Interestingly the encoder-decoder framework focuses
                      on translating text into a spectrogram which can then be interpreted into a 
                      waveform instead of the other way around. No hand-engineered HMM aligner
                      is required to make this work.}
